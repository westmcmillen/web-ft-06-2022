# Lists and Stuff

array = []
list = []

A known index of a list/array is O(1)
Inserting a value into the a list/array is O(N)
Reading an entire list is O(N)


# BIG O NOTATION
Time and Space Complexity
How big will data be and how much time will it be to place data
Tracks the worst case scenario

O(1) = Constant Time AKA Instantly
O(N) = N is whatever the size of the list is - worst case scenario
O(N * N) = worse - worse case scenario

creating a list takes O(N) complexity
reading a list of a known index takes O(1)
updating a list at a known index takes O(1)
updating a list takes O(N)
reading an entire list takes O(N)
deleting a list at a known index takes O(N)
